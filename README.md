# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn for a telecom company. It uses various models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with an emphasis on data preprocessing, class balancing, and evaluation metrics.

## üìä Project Overview

The dataset used is the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn based on attributes such as demographics, account information, and usage behavior.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost
* imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
* Pickle

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**

   * Missing values in `TotalCharges` handled.
   * Irrelevant column (`customerID`) dropped.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

   * Distribution and box plots for numeric features.
   * Count plots for categorical variables.
   * Correlation heatmap.

3. **Preprocessing**

   * Label Encoding for categorical features.
   * SMOTE applied to address class imbalance.

4. **Model Training**

   * Trained Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models using 5-fold cross-validation.
   * Random Forest showed best performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Evaluated on test data using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.

6. **Model Deployment**

   * Saved trained model and encoders using Pickle.
   * Loaded and used for a sample prediction.
